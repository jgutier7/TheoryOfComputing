# Theory of Computing Projects
This repo contains project work for my Theory of Computing course.
PC1: This project involves implementing a solution to simulate nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) using a third approach that runs in O(|δ|n) time, where |δ| is the number of transitions. The project includes designing a data structure for representing NFA, reading and writing NFA definitions, implementing a matching function to test whether an NFA accepts a string, and creating a command-line tool to run the NFA on a given string and output the result along with the accepting path.

PC2: This project involves writing a regular expression matcher similar to grep, with three major steps: parsing a regular expression into regular operations, executing the regular operations to create a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and running the NFA on input strings. The regular expression matcher is expected to be faster than regular expression engines in Perl or Python due to the use of a linear-time NFA recognition algorithm. The project includes tasks such as designing a parser for regular expressions, implementing functions for regular operations (union, concatenation, and star), converting a regular expression syntax tree to an NFA, and creating a grep replacement program called agrep. The program should match entire lines of input strings against the regular expression. The project also includes running tests and evaluating the time complexity of the agrep program.

PC3: The project involves re-implementing a fragment of the Unix tool 'sed', which uses regular expressions to make changes to a file. The tasks include extending the regular expression matcher to capture and reconstruct groups, implementing the 's' command for substitution and the 'b' command for conditional branching in 'sed', and demonstrating the Turing-completeness of the fragment by creating a translator from Turing machines to 'sed' scripts.

PC4: The project focuses on extending the functionality of the 'grep' tool by allowing backreferences within regular expressions. Backreferences are implemented by adding a preprocessing step to tokenize the input and modifying the regular expression parser accordingly. The project also involves modifying the NFA matching function to handle backreferences and implementing a SAT solver by reducing Boolean satisfiability to regular expression matching with backreferences.
